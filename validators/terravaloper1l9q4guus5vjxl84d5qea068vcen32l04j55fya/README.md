## Validator Mission 

At greenfriendlylabs, we dedicate ourselves to providing a secure and reliable validator for Terra Classic (LUNC). Originally launched as LUNA in 2018, LUNC represents the genesis of the Terra blockchain. Today, LUNC is community-driven, marking a transformative era in its development.

Mission 2030: At greenfriendlylabs.com, we actively pursue sustainability beyond blockchain. By 2030, we aim to implement a transparent model for allocating staking fees: 75% will support sustainable projects worldwide, 15% will fund the continuous development of our infrastructure, and 10% will cover the validator’s operating costs. Moreover, this balanced approach not only ensures that our operations remain efficient but also, at the same time, enhances our ability to contribute significantly to shaping a greener and more sustainable future.

In the dynamic and rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem, choosing the right staking partner for LUNC is crucial. At greenfriendlylabs, we prioritize sustainability by using energy-efficient hardware and hosting solutions powered by renewable energy. This ensures that our blockchain operations align with the goals of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles.

Security is at the core of our approach: robust backup systems provide a safe environment for staking. Additionally, we take a community-focused approach by actively collaborating with the LUNC community to strengthen the ecosystem and promote sustainable growth.

Spread the word and encourage your friends to stake their LUNC with greenfriendlylabs – for a more sustainable future.
